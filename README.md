# Quick PDF downloader #

Quick &amp; dirty tool to download multiple PDFs listed on an html webpage.

## How to use ##

$./get_pdf THE_URL_WHERE_THE_PDFs_ARE_LISTED 

In case the files are not listed with the complete URLs, you can specify the base url as a second optional argument:


$./get_pdf THE_URL_WHERE_THE_PDFs_ARE_LISTED BASE_URL

Enjoy! :-)
